# Search discovery

Implemented on 2026-09-07. The production canonical URL is `https://sparrowstudio.app/`, consistently used in the HTML canonical tag, Open Graph URL, and sitemap. Open Graph and large-image social-card metadata use the existing Studio screenshot from the upstream README.

The native "About 2D nesting" disclosure is present in the initial HTML and opens as an expandable section inside the About dialog. It describes textiles, garment cutting, woodworking, CNC routing, sheet metal, laser/plasma/waterjet layouts, printing and print-and-cut work, signs, packaging, foam, rubber, leather, composites, and research. It explains supported imports and exports, rectangular-strip packing, local processing, and the distinction between nesting outlines and preparing machine or print instructions.

The content stays hidden outside the dialog while the editor is running, and the same HTML node moves into About when opened. Closing the dialog returns it to its hidden location and collapses it. With JavaScript disabled, a noscript style makes the disclosure accessible directly. There is no bottom bar and no reduction in canvas height. No duplicate copy, new rendering framework, or dependency was added.

After this placement change, type checking, the frontend build, and 18 browser checks passed across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. Tests cover opening and closing About repeatedly, native expansion, full editor height, responsive layout, and the no-JavaScript fallback. Google permits content hidden for normal expandable interfaces, but identical ranking or snippet treatment is not guaranteed.

## Screenshot provenance

- Source: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d84bb67-ff98-4310-82de-5350baa02427
- Local copy: `web/public/sparrow-studio-social.png`, PNG resized proportionally to 1200 by 726 pixels, 352,460 bytes. The original screenshot was 1,609,312 bytes, exceeding Signal Desktop's 1 MiB preview-download limit. A new asset URL avoids reusing the old image cache.
- The screenshot shows Studio with irregular parts in a checked layout. Metadata includes the actual image dimensions and descriptive alternative text. Social platforms may crop their previews differently.
- The thumbnail was generated with `sips -Z 1200` from the original README screenshot. The editor does not request the sharing image. Browser tests check this and enforce an image size below 1 MiB so the asset cannot silently add to startup downloads or exceed Signal's limit.

## Validation

From `web`:

- `rtk npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `rtk npm test`: 111 tests passed.
- `rtk npx vite build`: passed using existing compiled WASM assets.
- `rtk npx playwright test tests/discovery.spec.ts tests/backlog.spec.ts tests/startup.spec.ts`: 30 tests passed across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

Tests inspect raw HTML, canonical/social URLs, PNG dimensions, robots.txt, and sitemap output. They also exercise native keyboard expansion without JavaScript, desktop/mobile layout, initial collapsed state, and existing startup behavior. Chromium screenshots at 1440 and 390 pixels were visually inspected.

## Publication and indexing

Production was checked on 2026-09-07: the homepage, robots.txt, sitemap and 352,460-byte sharing image all return HTTP 200 with the correct content types. Canonical and social tags match the production URL, the introduction is present in the initial HTML, crawling is allowed and no noindex directive was found. Public site-search returned no results, which does not establish whether Google has indexed the site. The owner subsequently confirmed successful domain verification, sitemap submission and an indexing request in Google Search Console. Actual indexing and search performance remain to be checked.

Remaining steps:

1. Production publication checks are complete.
2. In a verified Search Console property for sparrowstudio.app, inspect the homepage's live URL and rendered content, request indexing, and submit `https://sparrowstudio.app/sitemap.xml`. Account verification may require the domain owner's DNS access. No verification token or account access was supplied for this work.
3. Inspect the social preview in LinkedIn's Post Inspector, without publishing a post, to verify image cropping and refresh its cache.
4. Monitor impressions and queries such as "2D nesting", "online nesting", and "print and cut nesting". Metadata and a sitemap do not guarantee indexing or rankings.

The Studio README now links directly to the live editor. The sibling sparrow checkout has only its existing demo-callout wording changed to "Try 2D nesting with sparrow in your browser"; its unrelated changes were preserved. That README change needs publication separately through the sparrow repository.

Signal limit verified against [its preview fetch implementation](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/blob/main/ts/linkPreviews/linkPreviewFetch.preload.ts). The old live PNG returned HTTP 200 with the correct image/png type; the missing thumbnail was consistent with its oversized response. Actual rendering in Signal remains a post-deployment check. Existing messages may retain their original preview.

Product copy now emphasizes open-source software rather than "free": the browser title is "sparrow/studio | Open-source 2D nesting" and sharing titles are "sparrow/studio: Open-source 2D nesting in your browser". Descriptions and the introduction use the same positioning; "free rotation" retains its geometric meaning.

Search descriptions and the About introduction now explicitly describe Studio as free and open-source. The introduction clarifies that importing, nesting and downloading layouts are free to use. Browser and sharing titles retain the open-source branding.
