# sparrow/studio

An interactive browser demo of the sparrow nesting algorithm, developed from [the design plan](../notes/web-app-design.md). The app is independent of the original sparroWASM wrapper. The "Say hello" button opens Jeroen’s LinkedIn and email links. Its hand waves once after the first layout download, unless reduced motion is preferred.

## Build and run

Use Python 3, Node.js, stable Rust, nightly Rust 2026-08-30 with rust-src, and wasm-pack. From `web/`:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain stable
rustup toolchain install nightly-2026-08-30 --component rust-src --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
npm ci
npm run wasm:build
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm test
npx playwright install chromium firefox webkit
npm run test:e2e
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Run `npm run wasm:build` before the first development session and before unit tests after changing Rust. SVG tests execute the compiled usvg parser. Both `build` and `test:e2e` compile the actual WASM sources; neither depends on an untracked prebuilt binary. `test:e2e` tests production `dist` on port 4173 in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. `npx playwright test --list` lists the current cases; `npx playwright test tests/theme.spec.ts` reuses an already built `dist`.

The build isolates Cargo from the ancestor wrapper configuration. It pins sparrow to merged main revision `7f0e10f946f70a86138d3938548a13ee46464f39` including [PR #165](https://github.com/JeroenGar/sparrow/pull/165) and uses unmodified jagua-rs 0.8.3 from crates.io. Failed initial placement returns an explanatory error; exact material-boundary contact retains upstream collision semantics. Four WASM variants use pinned nightly Rust: serial and shared-memory, each with and without SIMD. SIMD builds enable Sparrow’s portable-SIMD collision kernel and `+simd128`; compatibility builds disable SIMD. Both shared-memory variants rebuild the standard library with atomics and wasm-bindgen-rayon 1.3.0. A native feature probe selects SIMD when supported, including for SVG import. Shared-memory startup can fall back to serial independently. Diagnostics record the initialized variant in `solverBinary`, alongside the solver revision and actual thread count. Exact resolved dependencies are in the npm and Cargo lockfiles.

## Static hosting and threads

Publish the complete contents of `dist/` on one HTTPS origin, at either `/` or a repository subdirectory such as `/sparrow-studio/`. Vite's base is relative. Preserve the `assets/`, `examples/`, notice files and `isolation-worker.js` paths. Use a trailing slash for a subdirectory URL. There is no server API or client-side router.

Development sends cross-origin isolation headers. Production preview deliberately omits them to exercise the static-host fallback needed for GitHub Pages. A same-origin service worker adds isolation response headers and reloads once at startup, before the editable document exists. It caches nothing. Browsers that cannot establish isolation or initialize the pool use the serial solver.

Solver options offer Automatic or 1–3 threads. Automatic reserves one reported logical core and caps the solver at three threads. The bottom bar reports the workers used by the current search phase; Solver options and diagnostics show browser fallback reasons. Standard is the default and uses Sparrow’s standard search settings. Fast imports the search values from `sparrow_extended/src/config.rs` (`FAST_SPARROW_CONFIG`): quicker, greedier progress with potentially worse final packing. Fast uses up to two exploration workers and three compression workers, bounded by the selected pool. Both presets retain Sparrow’s default engine simplification, user clearance and stop-condition controls. The preset is saved in project files; older projects use Standard. Stop disposes both the solver coordinator and its Rayon workers; starting again creates a fresh pool. Native failure-based auto-termination can finish before the selected time cap. This is not a claim that threaded search is always faster.

Live snapshots are serialized at most every 100 ms; feasible results and the final result are always delivered. Studio accepts Sparrow’s feasible results directly. Export checks preserve serialization fidelity without repeating solver geometry checks. Imported project results are still checked against the imported geometry. Skip to compression signals the existing optimizer through shared memory, following the native phase transition without restarting. When shared memory is unavailable, the serial solver still runs and stops normally, but Skip is unavailable.

## Deployment

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds and publishes GitHub Pages on pushes to `main`, or through its manual Run workflow action. It installs Node 24, stable Rust, nightly 2026-08-30 and wasm-pack 0.15.0, uses the dependency lockfiles, and builds all four solver variants. Unit tests and the Chromium production browser suite must pass before the Pages artifact is published. A failed build leaves the previous deployment in place.

The initial Pages address is https://jeroengar.github.io/sparrow-studio/. The custom domain is `sparrowstudio.app`, registered at Spaceship. GitHub Pages remains the host when a custom domain is connected. The repository and website are public.

Domain setup uses GitHub's repository Pages setting, four apex A records pointing to `185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, `185.199.110.153` and `185.199.111.153`, and a `www` CNAME pointing to `jeroengar.github.io`. Keep the `_github-pages-challenge-JeroenGar` TXT record used for account-level domain verification. HTTPS is provided by GitHub Pages. The custom domain is configured in GitHub settings; Actions publishing does not use a CNAME file in the build.

After deployment, check a fresh browser session for startup isolation, a checked nesting result, Stop/restart, dataset loading and downloads. Browser-stored shapes are tied to the origin: localhost, github.io and the custom domain have separate libraries.

## Supported work

- The editor opens while the bundled `gardeyn2.json` example loads and prepares in the background, without automatically running the solver. The status bar shows loading progress; creating, opening, or editing a project takes precedence over the pending example. A failed example leaves the editor usable. New project starts empty. The project-name menu groups New, Import, Rename and examples; Export project downloads a named ZIP containing the editable project, CLI input when there are active copies, and checked SVG/DXF when available. Import project restores these archives or legacy project JSON, including empty projects. The header reports pending, completed, and failed IndexedDB saves independently of ZIP exports. Browser storage keeps only the current project; replacing work not yet exported offers Export project and continue, Replace without exporting, or Cancel. Undo stays within the current project.
- Import shapes adds sparrow instance JSON, closed-contour SVG and the documented planar ASCII DXF subset without changing the current name or material settings. Import is reviewed before changing the drawing. Saved project files restore a complete job; instance JSON also offers an explicit Open as new project action.
- Examples can be opened for preparation or opened and nested. Shape-library collections provide reusable ingredients; Command/Control-click toggles selection and Shift-click selects a range for one bulk import.
- Prepare parts with exact position and proportional size fields, group movement, rotation, drag handles, grid/angle snapping, duplicate/delete, and undo/redo. New/imported shape types are arranged compactly, with copies evenly offset near their parent. Each copy is independently movable; manual overlaps are allowed. Shift-drag selects a group. R advances to the next permitted orientation (90° for continuous rotation); +/− changes copies, Command/Control+D clones selected copies, and Delete/Backspace removes them while retaining zero-quantity types.
- The coordinate grid subdivides as you zoom, with linear top/left rulers in the active units. Part properties open separately from Material & run; click the selected part in the list, click the canvas background, press Escape, or close the inspector to deselect. The orange nesting action stays at the bottom left.
- SVG/DXF/PDF downloads capture manual layouts while idle or the best valid solution. Downloads are disabled in live search view and while nesting has no valid solution. ZIP exports include the checked result when available.
- Switch between millimetres and inches in About. Display preferences persist; geometry and exports stay in canonical millimetres. Changing units or leaving an unchanged numeric field does not round geometry or invalidate checked results.
- The last project is recovered automatically from IndexedDB in the same browser and site. Edits are saved after a 500 ms pause, with an additional save attempt when hiding or leaving the page. Recovery preserves parts, settings, copy placements, and completed checked results; results are revalidated on restore and solving never restarts automatically. An interrupted write can lose the latest edits. Storage errors show a reminder to download a project ZIP; browser recovery does not replace that backup. An unreadable recovery entry is preserved and automatic writes are disabled for that session.
- Browse all 34 main/Gardeyn benchmark files as complete sample projects. Each sample uses one uniform factor per source file so its median shape-type net area (outer minus holes) is 10,000 mm² (100 mm × 100 mm); material width, clearance and preparation positions scale with the geometry while demand and rotation rules stay intact. The reusable shape library applies the same per-source normalization to individual shape types; the bundled JSON keeps its original coordinates.
- Save personal shapes in IndexedDB on this browser/device. Geometry is validated on read/write. Web Locks serialize mutations across tabs. Personal shapes are subject to the same 500-type/100,000-vertex guard as a project. Browser storage can be cleared; explicit project downloads are backups.
- View intermediate search layouts with red overlap regions or the best solver-feasible result. Ghost mode keeps thin outlines and a 10% white fill in dark mode or 10% black fill in light mode, with a transparent material background. Nesting and editing share one canvas and preserve its camera.
- Download the current canvas or checked layout as SVG, ASCII DXF, or vector PDF. PDF converts the exported SVG to vector paths, preserving colors, holes, and physical dimensions without raster images; the converter loads only when needed. SVG fits the viewing window with a padded viewBox, material frame, part colors and a layout summary. Its declared page dimensions include the margin; geometry stays in millimetres. The importer ignores the marked decorative group. Projects and diagnostics can also be downloaded. System is the initial theme; explicit Light and Dark preferences persist.

SVG uses usvg 0.48.1 through the serial WASM module, loaded only when importing SVG. It resolves supported CSS, inherited styles, affine transforms, local use/symbol references, nested viewports and primitive shapes before Studio flattens closed paths and interprets compound holes. Different SVG paths are independent parts, even when they overlap, touch or enclose one another. Only subpaths within the same path define compound holes. Hidden/unpainted shapes are omitted. Text and images are excluded; scripts, external references, clipping/masks/filters and open paths are rejected. Nested viewports must not apply clipping (use overflow="visible"). usvg uses single-precision coordinates; imported dimensions can differ by floating-point rounding, and the curve tolerance applies to its resolved paths. For `preserveAspectRatio="slice"`, complete cutting contours are imported with an explicit warning; viewport cropping is not applied.

DXF uses pinned `dxf` 5.3.1 for parsing and spline evaluation. It supports planar LINE, ARC, CIRCLE, ELLIPSE, LWPOLYLINE with bulges, ordinary 2D POLYLINE/VERTEX, and continuous degree 1–3 SPLINE curves with positive weights and control points. Nested blocks and INSERT arrays are expanded with base points, rotation, scaling, and layer inheritance. Recognized INSUNITS are honored. Curves retain the selected millimetre approximation tolerance after transforms; excessively fine spline tolerances are rejected rather than silently coarsened. Layer selection and explicit exclusion of invalid contours are available. Endpoint gaps up to 0.01 mm join only when unambiguous. Binary DXF, higher-degree or fit-point-only splines, hatches, dimensions, text and 3D entities are outside this subset. DXF export includes explicit object handles and model/paper-space ownership for strict readers such as QCAD. It is R2000 with closed LWPOLYLINE entities on PARTS/HOLES layers and Sparrow Studio attribution text on a separate non-plotting SPARROW_INFO layer. SVG captions include the same attribution and a clickable site URL.

Holes remain in geometry and exports, but the solver reserves each entire outer footprint. Other parts cannot nest inside holes. Clearance is part-to-part distance; the solver also reserves an edge allowance, disclosed in settings. Original curves are exported as the same polygonal approximation used for validation. This is not a toolpath generator or manufacturing certification.

Limits are 10 MiB/file, 25 MiB/import batch, 500 demanded copies, 5,000 vertices/part including holes, 100,000 demanded vertices and coordinate extents of 100,000 mm. Validation uses 1e-6 mm linear tolerance and 1e-8 mm² overlap tolerance per pair. A failed check never silently loosens either tolerance.

## Verification

On 2026-09-05, `npm test` passed **109 tests in 17 files**. The production build compiled both WASM variants and type-checked the application. The browser suite covers **176 checks** across Chromium, Firefox and WebKit; four Chromium-specific touch checks are intentionally skipped in the other engines. Coverage includes imports/exports, checked-result ownership, Stop/restart, thread fallback and disposal, privacy, copy/group editing, local library persistence, display units, keyboard and 390 px layouts. Five native tests cover termination, presets, clearance and exact material fits. Physical iPhone/iPad testing has not been performed.

Native Safari 26.6 also completed a production run, Stop and restart using three solver threads. Desktop and mobile normal/ghost views were inspected with computer use. All three browser engines passed a separate `/repo/` static-host test, including isolation-worker scope and thread restart; Chromium additionally verified worker-pool disposal directly.

Independent XML/GEOS checks passed 12 exported SVGs, and ezdxf/GEOS checks passed three holed DXF exports. The public repository contains the sources needed to rebuild all four WASM variants and the complete static app using the documented toolchains and dependency lockfiles.

Two generated 100,000-vertex preparation workloads imported and remained interactive with no measured main-thread task over 50 ms. Those extreme workloads reached the solver initialization watchdog before producing a candidate; being under the import limits does not guarantee a completed nesting result. Stop remained responsive. High-limit candidate-validation responsiveness was therefore not measured. See [the performance record](../notes/preparation-performance.md) and [acceptance audit](../notes/web-app-acceptance-audit.md) for the machine, methods and precise scope. Physical iPhone/iPad testing has not been performed.

Independent export checks, from `web/`:

```sh
uv run --with shapely==2.1.2 python tests/audit_bridge.py path/to/candidates.json
uv run --with shapely==2.1.2 python tests/audit_export.py path/to/layout.svg
uv run --with ezdxf==1.4.3 --with shapely==2.1.2 python tests/audit_dxf.py path/to/plate.dxf --copies 1 --holes 1 --area 5600
```

Playwright saves downloads/screenshots under `test-results/`. For the native clearance fixture, isolate Cargo flags:

```sh
cd /tmp
CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS='' cargo +stable test --manifest-path /absolute/path/to/sparrow-studio/web/wasm/Cargo.toml --locked -- --nocapture
```

The historical native fixture requested a 2 mm gap between 10 mm rectangles in a 16 mm strip and measured a 2.0056553 mm gap. Exact fits now accept a fixed sampling coordinate and contact with a rectangular material boundary, without padding dimensions or allowing parts outside the material. Native regression tests cover exact fits, outside-boundary rejection and item collisions.

## Privacy and notices

Files, geometry and diagnostics are processed locally. Ordinary static asset requests still reach the host and can appear in its access logs. Explicit GitHub/LinkedIn/paper links navigate externally. Cloudflare Web Analytics measures traffic and performance only on sparrowstudio.app and www.sparrowstudio.app in production builds. No project names, file contents, or geometry are supplied to the beacon. No social embeds, external fonts, account service or upload endpoint is included. Local previews do not load analytics; the privacy browser test permits only known built-asset GETs and checks import/export content is absent from request URLs, bodies and headers.

Third-party full texts and source references are in `public/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`, the two `public/RUST-LIBRARY-*.html` files and `public/examples/NOTICE.txt`. Regenerate/check from the repository root:

```sh
python3 web/scripts/generate-notices.py
python3 web/scripts/generate-notices.py --check

See [the notices audit](../notes/notices-audit.md) for exact upstream packaging gaps and source availability. The public sparrow-studio repository contains the application and WASM bridge; exact upstream dependency sources are linked in the notices. Preserve the notice files when publishing, and verify their deployed relative links.
